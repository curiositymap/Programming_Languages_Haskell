# Syntactic Sugar
1. What is Syntactic Sugar? 
- In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. 
- It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

2. What is Syntactic Sugar important for Programming Languages? 
- A good use case of Syntactic Sugar makes code base easier to read and less error-prone. 
- Generally, fewer lines of code are less likely to prompt bugs, so it is encouraged to write an elegant code style using Syntactic Sugar.

3. Syntatic Sugar in Haskell
- In Haskell, strings are just lists of characters. 
- For example, "hello" is just syntactic sugar for ['h','e','l','l','o']. Because strings are lists, we can use list functions on them, which is really handy.
